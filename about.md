# About Me:

<img src="/img/about/me.jpg" class="float-right" />

My name is Tiernan O'Rourke.
I'm currently a software engineer primarily using C, C++, and Java as well as Rust for hobby projects.

I enjoy spending time learning more about cross-platform native application development, frontend/backend web development, web application security practices, computer graphics programming, and emulation.
